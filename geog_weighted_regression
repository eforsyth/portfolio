# geographically weighted regression

# geographically weighted regression (gwr) is a special form of regression that incorporates geographic impacts into the regression analysis
# regular regression assumes that the relationship between predictors and the response are constant (or that the relationship is stationary). in the context of geography this translates
# as "I assume this relationship does not vary across sapce". gwr relaxes this asusmption allowing the relationshp between the predictors and the response to vary across space
# regular regression can be thought of, then, as a global average while gwr will tell us where this relationship diverges significantly from this average
