# Cycle crashes

This little project aims to explore the spatial distribution of cycle crashes across Auckland.

This involves aggregating the crash point events to a generated hexbin tesselation. Aggregating the points in this manner offers a different approach to the explicit point pattern methods covered in the point pattern analysis demo **(ADD LINK?)**.
