# point patterns analysis

#

# there are two types of point pattern analysis: density based and distance based. both of which are briefly demonstrated here.


# libraries
library(spatstat) # for point pattern analysis


# in contrast to the other R examples, we do not use sf here to handle our spatial data as spatstat is so old that it uses its own data structures, independent of sf
# the spatstat syntax is closer to the base R language so can be a bit ugly...

# read in cycle crashes


# create quick data vis of crashes over time
# heatmap


# density based analysis ------------------------------------
# density based analysis deals with how the pattern pertains to an unerlying covariate


# we will look at the density of crashes as a function of population density



# distance based analysis -----------------------------------
# with distance based analysis we look at the distribution of points relative to other points
