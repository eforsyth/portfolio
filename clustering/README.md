# Spatially constrained clustering

These clustering methods focus on both classic clustering and spatially constrained clustering methods. Classic clustering techniques (such as k-means or agglomerative clustering) are frequently applied to spatial data. While popular, these techniques are what we call <ins>attribute-space</ins> methods that does not explicitly consider <ins>geographic-space</ins>. When we need to produce geographically contigious clusters, we can add constraints forcing the algorithms to consider both attribute-space <ins>and</ins> geographic-space. Thus, we shift from clustering to spatially constrained clustering.
