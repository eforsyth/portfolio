# Basic data visualisation

# Demonstrated methods include treemapping, donut plots, comparative dot plots, and scatter plots with marginal distributions. 
# Work is based off a project at Market Economics and includes identifying statistically significant clusters of Maori across the region (related to original M.E project). 
# Data is simply selected 2018 census variables for SA1's across Southland.

# libraries
library(sf)        # spatial data handling
library(spdep)     # spatial dependency
library(ggplot)    # data vis
library(tidyverse) # assorted 'tidy' libraries

# read in sa1 data
data_sa1 <- read_sf("", '')

# identify Maori clusters
# original project called for identification of Maori clusters for reporting and future analysis. utilised concept of spatial autocorrelation to identify clusters.
# identified clusters were checked by local experts (including iwi members) who verified accuracy.

# donut plots
# clearer variation of the (correctly) much maligned pie chart.


# comparative dot plots
# highlights the differences between values.


# scatter plots
# includes marginal distributions which provide additional visual information without cluttering the main vis panel.
# histogram is used here, but other marginal distribution options include density and boxplots.
