# Portfolio

A portfolio containing examples of coding skills and applications of GIS data handling and spatial statistical methods. Examples encompass geodemographics, geographically weighted regression, working with human mobility/GPS data, network analysis, point pattern analysis, and some basic data visualisation. Examples are a mostly R with some Python included.

All data comes from open sources. Some come directly from various API's accessed in the scripts, others are downloaded prior and bundled into the data folder.
