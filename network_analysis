# network analysis

# using Python to conduct basic network analysis for Takapuna on Auckland's north shore
# 
# data is downloaded from openstreetmap (osm)

# libraries
import geopandas as gdp # for general spatial data handling
import osmnx as ox      # for network analysis


# download + clean osm network
# cleaning network data can be onerous, so is great that this function does an excellent job doing it for us
# specifying a driving network but can specify other transport modes, such as walking or public transit


# route through network
# routing from randomly selected origin nodes to random destination node


# visualise results


# centrality measures
# hail from original graph theory where they assess structure of the graph
# centrality = 
# betweeness = how often each node is passed in a full od matrix. useful for gauging number of people passing by the node
