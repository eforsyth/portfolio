# Cycle crash clusters

This little project aims to explore the spatial distribution of cycle crashes across Auckland. In doing so we cover various geographic data science based approaches to the task, and highlight how even a relatively simple sounding task can encompass a bunch of methodological issues and technical work. Specifically, we cover point pattern, data mining, and spatial autocorrelation measures. To briefly summarise each:

- The point pattern approach ... 
- The data mining approach uses DBSCAN to discover dense clusters of crashes, as defined by a density function.
- The spatial autocorrelation approach uses Monte Carlo (i.e. randomised) simulations to identify clusters of unexpectedly high counts.

Note that we use crash counts/events. Using crash rates may also yield addional insight, however calculating the rate is too much effort as of the time of writing, but could be added at some point in the future.
