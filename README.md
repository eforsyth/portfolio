# Portfolio

A portfolio containing examples of coding skills applied to spatial data handling and geographic data science methods. [The main directory covers identifying geographic clusters of cycle crashes in Auckland](https://github.com/eforsyth/portfolio/tree/main/cycle_crashes), while [the miscellaneous directory](https://github.com/eforsyth/portfolio/tree/main/assorted) that includes assorted little tasks.

Examples are a mostly R with some Python included.

Is still very much a work in progress...
