# Multivariate clustering

These clustering methods focus on k-means and REDCAP, a spatially constrained hierarchical clustering method. The first of these, k-means, is a popular technique that is frequently applied to spatial data, particularly in the field of geodemographics. k-means, however, is a pure attribute-space method that does not consider geographic-space. When we need to produce geographically contigious clusters, then we can add spatial constraints forcing the algorithms to consider both attribute-space *and* geographic-space.

Note that value of k is arbitrarily chosen for these examples.
