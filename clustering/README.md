# Multivariate clustering

These clustering methods focus on the two methods of k-means and REDCAP, a spatially constrained hierarchical clustering method. The first of these, k-means, is a popular technique that is frequently applied to spatial data, particularly in the field of geodemographics. While popular, k-means, is what we call a pure attribute-space method that does not consider geographic-space. When we need to produce geographically contigious clusters, we can add constraints forcing the algorithms to consider both attribute-space *and* geographic-space. Thus we shift from clustering to spatially constrained clustering.

Note that value of k (the number of clusters) is arbitrarily chosen for these examples.
