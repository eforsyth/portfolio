# multivariate clustering

# clustering methods focus on k-means and a spatially constrained clustering method. 
# k-means is pure attribute-space and does not consider geographic-space. can add spatial constraints forcing clusters to respect geography and produce geographically contigious clusters.
# value of k is arbitrarily chosen

# could have used k-means instead of agglomerative hierarchical clustering but didn't for reasons of fairness
# k-means is a partitioning method where as spatially constrained clustering is a hierarchical method. thus, we use agglomerative clustering as it is also a hierarchical method
# additionally, the agglomerative hierarchical clustering method is incorporated into our spatially constrained method
# k-means results would be equally as geographically discontigious as the agglomerative method
